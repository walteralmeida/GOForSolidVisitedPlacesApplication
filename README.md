# GOForSolidVisitedPlacesApplication

This is the code source for the presentation I am doing on SOLID World May, with following abstract : 

*Walter Almeida is the developer, entrepreneur who created Generative Objects (GO) (with link to https://www.generativeobjects.com), a low code development platform that he is now open sourcing. 
In this talk, he will present his plan and progress for evolving GO in order to model and generate SOLID applications quickly, with a minimum of code. Walter already built a GO connector to a SOLID Pod and to Sparql end points and is demonstrating it though the creation of a  SOLID application to track visited countries and places, leveraging dbPedia.org as a data source.*


This code source is fully generated from Generative Objects low-code platform.

I will put more detailed information in this readme in the following days
